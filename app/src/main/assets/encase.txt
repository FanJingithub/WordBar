The original plan was to encase a small amount of a radioactive substance in a protective steel container.
原先计划是要将少量的放射性物质封存在一个钢质防护罩中。The bag eats encase, is salary OK under minimum wage standard? 
包吃包住, 工资就可以低于最低工资标准 吗 ?
 To is cased ; to is encase. 
用木箱装. 
Accordingly, even if the bag eats encase, salary also cannot under minimum wage standard. 
因此, 即使是包吃包住, 工资也不能低于最低工资标准.
