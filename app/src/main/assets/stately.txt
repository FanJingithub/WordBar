Instead of moving at his usual stately pace, he was almost running.
他没像平时那样优雅庄重地走着，而是几乎跑了起来。
The building rose before him, tall and stately.
那座高大宏伟的建筑耸立在他面前。
a line of stately elms
一排雄伟壮观的榆树
an avenue of stately chestnut trees
两边有雄伟高大栗树的林荫道
The procession moved at a slow and stately speed. 
队伍以缓缓而庄严的速度行进.
Priceless antique furniture was destroyed in the fire at the stately home. 
那座富丽堂皇的宅第里价值连城的古董家具在大火中付之一炬了. 
Whenever the stately national anthem is performed, I am invariably emotionally roused. 
每当奏起庄严的国歌时, 我总在感情上受到激发.
The stately swan glides gracefully on the pond. 
天鹅在池面上优美地游动. 
He declined the invitation with stately grace. 
他庄严而文雅地谢绝了邀请. 
 The stately mansion crested the hill. 
庄严的大厦位于山顶.
