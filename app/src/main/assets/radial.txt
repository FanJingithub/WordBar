 The radial displacement must be accompanied by a circumferential force. 
径向位移必须伴有圆周力. 
Radial distances from CP or CL are too short. 
从投影中心或投影中线的辐射距离太短. 
The radial displacement must be accompanied by a hoop force. 
径向位移必定伴随着圆环力. 
The radial nerve supplies the triceps ( and arconeus ) with fibers derived primarily  from C 6, 7 and C 8. 
桡神经主要接收C6 、 C7和C8纤维,供应肱三头股 ( 和特后肌 ). 
A central force is a radial force which depends only on the distance from the origin. 
有心力是一种径向力,它的大小只取于离原点的距离. 
The system represented in one - line - diagram from in Fig 1 is a simple radial system. 
图1中用单线图表示的系统是一个简单的辐射状系统. 
  Also , in prior years, adjustment of the signal - generator and torque - generator stator mechanical radial positions was required. 
前些年对信号发生器和转矩发生器定子的机械半径位置也要进行调整.
