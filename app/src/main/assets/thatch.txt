They would live in a small house with a green door and a new thatch.
他们将住在一所新苫顶的绿门小房子里。
They lit a torch and set fire to the chapel's thatch.
他们点着一支火把，放火烧了小教堂的茅草屋顶。

Thatch hut is raised high above the paddy field on stilt. 
茅草屋用柱高高地建在稻田之上. 
They topped off the hut with a straw thatch. 
他们给小屋盖上茅草屋顶. 
 A distant flash, a rumble, and large drops of rain spattered on the thatch above him. 
远远一道电光, 一声低沉的雷声, 大点的雨滴滴哒哒打到他头上的茅屋顶上.
